## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- **`app/`**: Contains the core application files for the graph data visualization project. This includes all source code, libraries, and assets required to build and run the visualization tool.

- **`tex/`**: This folder holds the project report documentation. It contains LaTeX files and associated resources for generating the written report, detailing the projectâ€™s objectives, implementation, and findings.

This separation ensures a clear distinction between the project code and the accompanying documentation.
